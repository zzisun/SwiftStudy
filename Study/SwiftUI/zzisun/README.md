# What is this

@State

@Environment

@Bind





* The `environmentObject(_:)` modifier.:  passes data downward in the view hierarchy

* ` @EnvironmentObject` attribute.: this attribute in views that are lower down in the view hierarchy to receive data from views that are higher up.

* A binding controls the storage for a value, so you can pass data around to different views that need to read or write it.
